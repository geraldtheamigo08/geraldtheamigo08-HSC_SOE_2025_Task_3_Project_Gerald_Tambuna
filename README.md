HSC Software Engineering, 2025 Task 3

Braintain is a modern study app designed to help HSC students stay organised, focused, and productive. Built using Python with CustomTkinter, the app features a secure login and sign up system, a task manager with due dates and subject categories, a notes section for storing study content, and a built-in Pomodoro timer to support focused study sessions. Users can view tasks due today, see upcoming deadlines, and track their study progress through a clean, user-friendly interface. The app also features a a home page, showing the user a task count of tasks they have due today, and ones due in the next 2 weeks, enhancing the organisation and time-mapping experience for the user. All data is stored locally using SQLite, with password security handled via SHA-256 encryption. The information for users, tasks and notes is stored in the notes_app.db file. For styling, a .json file was used to have pre-set stylings applied to different customtkinter widgets. Ultimately, Braintain brings together essential productivity tools in one application, specifically for student success.
